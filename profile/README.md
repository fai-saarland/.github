# Foundations of Artificial Intelligence (FAI) Group

Much of the research in FAI involves the development of software as part of
the work. Our philosophy is to share the source code as much as possible. This
page gives links to most of our developments, so far as ready for release. All
downloadable material is free for research and educational purposes.
